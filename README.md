- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matthew-Speltz

- 👀 I’m interested in Infrastructure and Automation.  Networking is my career, but fundamentally anything high-level infrastructure I enjoy.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ansible.  I've begun to automate some basic things and I'm looking to automate my homelab (stuff breaks occasionally and I need it back!)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that interest me!  I don't have a lot of free time but would be willing to help the right project.
